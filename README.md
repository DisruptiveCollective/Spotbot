# Spotbot

First, you will need to install the Selenium Python library and the ChromeDriver executable, which allows you to control the Chrome browser via the Selenium API. Here is how you can do this:

Copy code
pip install selenium

# Download ChromeDriver executable from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
# and place it in a directory that is in your system's PATH


This code will create 100 sessions, one for each username and password pair in the credentials list. It will then search for the artist specified in the search_field.send_keys() function, click the first search result, and start playback.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
